      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>My name is Prerana Kulla, and I am a freshman here at Carolina. I'm from Harrisburg, NC, a small town on the outskirts of Charlotte, and I had lived in Morganton, NC, for the last two years of high school. I'm currently studying</p>
      <p>Neuroscience and Community & Global Public Health with a minor in Real Estate, and hope to bring my studies abroad for one semester in the future. At UNC, I work as a Residential Computing Consultant (RCC) through ResNET, where I've</p>
      <p> had the privilege of supporting many students and getting to know more about Carolina through this lens. I have gotten involved in Carolina Women in Business as well as CPALS, a group dedicated to supporting current/previous</p>
      <p>UNC-Hospitals Hematology-Oncology patients. Throughout this semester and in the future, I hope to get involved in clubs designated for outdoor sports, Indian fine arts, and dance.</p>
